## How to use it
    
   #### 1. Add weapon
    
   In this menu we are going to recieve this options:
      
      1. Assault Rifles
      2. Rifles
      3. Sub-Machine guns
      4. Sniper Rifles
      
        0. Go back
        
  When you choose any type of weapon, the program is going to ask for a name, origin country, bullets in the loader and gauge.
      
  #### 2. Delete weapon
  
  In this menu you are going to receive exactly the same as the before one
      
  But this time, when you choose a type of weapon, all weapons of that type will appear on your screen, so you can choose which to erase, or go back.  
  
  #### 3. Show weapons
  
  Like the other ones, you should choose what type of weapons you want to see and they will appear in your screen like that:
  
  ```
  1 - Name - "Weapon name", Origin country - "OriginCountry Name", Bullets - "Nº of bullets", Gauge - "Gauge".
  2 - Name - "Weapon name", Origin country - "OriginCountry Name", Bullets - "Nº of bullets", Gauge - "Gauge".
  ```
  
  #### 4. Modify weapon
  
  You are going to see, exactly the same menu, to choose the type of weapon:
  
  You are going to choose the weapon by the number of the index.
  
  ```
  1 - Name - "Weapon name", Origin country - "OriginCountry Name", Bullets - "Nº of bullets", Gauge - "Gauge".
  2 - Name - "Weapon name", Origin country - "OriginCountry Name", Bullets - "Nº of bullets", Gauge - "Gauge".
  ```
  After that one menu will appear asking you for the info about the weapon you want to change, something like:
  
     1. Name
     2. Origin Country
     3. Ammo in the clip
     4. Gauge
   
       0. Go back
       
  #### 5/6/7/8. Sort by...
      
  Quite simple, when you sort the names or origin country, we will do a alphabetic sort  
  
  When ordering the bullets in the loader or gauge, the ordering will be done from highest to lowest
